### Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

### I've completed the challenge, now what?

Hello Code Well team! I'm excited to submit my solution for the comment section challenge. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in creating a responsive and interactive comment section.

Implemented a fully responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes.

Gradient Background: Utilized gradient backgrounds to enhance visual appeal and add depth to the website.

Positioning for Lines: Employed precise positioning techniques to create visually appealing lines or separators within the layout.

Flexbox for Layout: Utilized Flexbox, a CSS layout model, to create flexible and efficient layouts, ensuring elements adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Relative Units for Responsiveness: Implemented relative units such as percentages, em, or rem for various elements, ensuring responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used :-

- HTML5
- CSS3(Flexbox)
